A modern React application built with **Vite** and **HeroUI** for discovering and managing interconnected posts. 

## Features

- **Post Management** - Create, read, and explore linked posts with an intuitive interface
- **HeroUI Components** - Beautiful, accessible UI components powered by HeroUI
- **Form Handling** - Robust form validation using React Hook Form and Zod
- **Data Fetching** - Efficient server state management with TanStack React Query and Axios

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** - Latest React with concurrent features
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast build tool with HMR
- **HeroUI 2** - Premium UI component library
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **TanStack React Query** - Powerful async state management
- **React Hook Form** - Performant form validation
- **Framer Motion** - Production-ready animation library


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
